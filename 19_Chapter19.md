## Chapter 19: JavaScript for Server-Side Web Development

Welcome back, my fellow tech aficionados! In our previous chapter, we learned about the best practices for writing secure JavaScript code. Today, we're shifting gears and diving into server-side web development with JavaScript!

To help us understand this topic even better, we have a very special guest with us today. He's the creator of Node.js himself, the one and only - Ryan Dahl!

But before we bring Ryan out, let's talk a bit about what server-side web development actually means.

Server-side web development involves executing code on the server-side rather than on the client-side. This means that we can build powerful web applications and APIs that can handle multiple requests at once, without overburdening the client-side.

This is where Node.js comes into play. By using JavaScript on the server-side, we can build scalable and high-performing web applications that can handle a large variety of use cases. But how exactly does this work? How do we write server-side code in JavaScript? 

Well, that's where Ryan Dahl comes in! He pioneered the concept of using JavaScript on the server-side and created Node.js - a JavaScript runtime environment that allows us to execute JavaScript code on the server-side.

So, let's bring on our special guest Ryan Dahl to teach us more about server-side web development with JavaScript!

### The Real Housewives of JavaScript

Welcome back, techies! On today's episode of "The Real Housewives of JavaScript," we explore the world of server-side web development with the help of our special guest, Ryan Dahl.

Our first housewife, Vanessa, wants to create a web application that can handle a high volume of user requests without slowing down. She's heard that Node.js and JavaScript can help her achieve her goal, but she's not sure how it all works.

Ryan Dahl swoops in to save the day and explains to Vanessa the magic behind Node.js. He explains that Node.js allows developers to write server-side code using JavaScript, which makes it easier to build scalable and high-performing web applications.

Vanessa is thrilled with this information and starts to brainstorm ideas for her new web application.

Meanwhile, our next housewife, Maria, is struggling with creating an API for her web application. She's not sure how to handle multiple requests simultaneously without slowing down the server.

Ryan Dahl jumps in again to help Maria with her problem. He explains that by using Node.js and JavaScript, you can write code that handles multiple requests at once - this is known as non-blocking I/O. This means that Maria can build a robust API that can handle many requests without overburdening the server.

Maria is excited to try out this new technique and thanks Ryan for his help.

Finally, our last housewife, Anna, needs help with integrating a database into her web application. She's not sure how to connect her JavaScript code to a database and store data.

Ryan Dahl comes to Anna's rescue once again and explains how she can use a library called "Mongoose" to connect to a MongoDB database and perform CRUD operations using JavaScript.

Anna is amazed by how easy it is to connect her JavaScript code to a database and notes that it opens up endless possibilities for her web application.

With Ryan Dahl's help, our housewives have mastered server-side web development with JavaScript and are well on their way to building scalable web applications.

### Resolution

In this chapter, we learned about the power of using Node.js and JavaScript for server-side web development. We saw how non-blocking I/O allows us to handle multiple requests at once and how we can connect to databases using Mongoose.

## Chapter 19: JavaScript for Server-Side Web Development

### Code Explanation

In this chapter, we explored server-side web development using JavaScript and Node.js. We saw how using JavaScript on the server-side allows us to write scalable and high-performing web applications.

To illustrate these concepts, we used a few key code snippets throughout the Real Housewives episodes.

#### Non-Blocking I/O

In Maria's problem, we saw how non-blocking I/O can help handle multiple requests simultaneously without overburdening the server. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates this technique:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

function onRequest(request, response) {
  console.log("Request received.");
  response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/plain"});
  response.write("Hello World");
  response.end();
}

http.createServer(onRequest).listen(8888);

console.log("Server has started.");
```

In this code snippet, we create a simple HTTP server that handles requests using the `onRequest` function. The `createServer` function sets up the server to listen on port 8888. The key to non-blocking I/O is that the `onRequest` function does not block the execution of other functions while it is executing. This means that other requests can be handled while one request is being processed.

#### Connecting to a Database

In Anna's problem, we saw how we can connect JavaScript code to a database using Mongoose. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates this technique:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/test', {useNewUrlParser: true});

const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const personSchema = new Schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number
});

const Person = mongoose.model('Person', personSchema);

const person = new Person({
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30
});

person.save(function (err) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
  } else {
    console.log('Saved successfully!');
  }
});
```

In this code snippet, we first connect to a MongoDB database located on the local machine. We then define a schema for a `Person` object and use the `model` function to create a model based on that schema. We create a `person` object using the `Person` model and save it to the database using the `save` function.

These code snippets show just a glimpse of the power of using JavaScript and Node.js for server-side web development. By mastering these concepts, we can build robust and scalable web applications that can handle many use cases.
