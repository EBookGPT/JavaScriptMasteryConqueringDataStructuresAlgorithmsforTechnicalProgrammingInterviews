# Chapter 18: Best Practices for Secure JavaScript Code

Welcome back to another exciting chapter of JavaScript Mastery: Conquering Data Structures Algorithms for Technical Programming Interviews! In our last chapter, we learned how to optimize our JavaScript code for improved performance. But, today we’re going to talk about something equally important - securing our JavaScript code.

We have a very special guest today, Tanya Janca, also known as "SheHacksPurple" on Twitter. Tanya is the founder of We Hack Purple Academy, and she's an Application Security Advocate, Bestselling Author, and Microsoft Cloud Advocate! She’s here to share her knowledge and expertise on securing our JavaScript code. Let's dive in!

## The Importance of Securing Your JavaScript Code

As JavaScript has become an essential part of web development, it's also become a prime target for attackers. Any vulnerabilities in the code can be exploited, leaving websites and applications open to various attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and even remote code execution.

It's important to secure your JavaScript code to ensure that your website/application is safe and free from cyber attacks. Today, Tanya Janca is here to share some best practices on how to secure your JavaScript code.

## Best Practices for Secure JavaScript Code 

1. **Validate all data:** It's important to validate all user inputs to ensure that they don't contain any malicious data that can compromise the security of your application. You can use libraries like **validator.js** or **Joi** to validate your data.
    ```javascript
    const Joi = require('joi');
     
    const schema = Joi.object().keys({
       username: Joi.string().alphanum().min(3).max(30).required(),
       password: Joi.string().regex(/^[a-zA-Z0-9]{3,30}$/),
       email: Joi.string().email({ minDomainAtoms: 2 })
    });
     
    Joi.validate({ username: 'abc123', birthyear: 1994 }, schema, function (err, value) { });
    ```

2. **Avoid eval() and with() methods:** Using eval() and with() methods can be very dangerous, as they can execute any code passed as an argument, making them vulnerable to malicious code injection. It's best to avoid using these methods altogether.
    ```javascript
    eval('console.log("Hello, World!")'); // Avoid using eval()
    
    with (document.forms[0])
    console.log(name.value); // Avoid using with()
    ```

3. **Avoid inline scripts:** Inline scripts or event handlers can be dangerous if not properly validated, as they can execute arbitrary code or even allow attackers to inject their own code. It's best to use external scripts and limit inline scripts or event handlers.
    ```html
    // bad
    <button onclick="alert('Hello, World!')">Click me!</button>
    
    // good
    <button id="btn">Click me!</button>
    
    <script>
      document.getElementById('btn').addEventListener('click', function() {
        alert('Hello, World!');
      });
    </script>
    ```

4. **Use Content Security Policy (CSP):** CSP helps prevent XSS attacks by restricting the sources of scripts, stylesheets, images, and other resources that a page can load. Implementing CSP adds an extra layer of security to your web application.
    ```html
    Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://apis.google.com;
    ```

5. **Handle errors gracefully:** Don't reveal too much information about the application's security mechanisms or the infrastructure. Handle errors gracefully, without revealing detailed error messages and stack traces to users.
    ```javascript
    // bad
    app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
      console.error(err.stack);
      res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
    });
    
    // good
    app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
      console.error(err);
      res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
    });
    ```

Those are some best practices to secure your JavaScript code, and we hope you found them useful. A huge thank you to our special guest, Tanya Janca, for sharing her knowledge and expertise with us.

# Real Housewives of JavaScript: Securing Your Code

Welcome back to another episode of Real Housewives of JavaScript! In our last episode, we learned about optimizing our JavaScript code for improved performance. Today, we're going to learn about securing our JavaScript code with our special guest, Tanya Janca!

## The Situation

The housewives are all gathered at the local coffee shop, discussing their recent web development projects. Jamie shares that her website was recently hacked, leaving her with a huge task ahead of her to secure her code and fix the vulnerabilities. The other housewives are concerned and want to know how they can prevent such a situation from happening to them.

## Tanya's Advice

Tanya chimes in and shares her best practices for securing JavaScript code. She explains that it's important to validate all data, avoid using eval() and with() methods, avoid inline scripts, use Content Security Policy (CSP), and handle errors gracefully.

The housewives are amazed at Tanya's knowledge and want to dive into each best practice in more detail.

## The Drama

As the housewives start to discuss their coding practices, it becomes clear that not all of them have been practicing safe coding habits. Some admit to using eval() and with() methods, while others have inline event handlers. The conversation gets heated when Claudia, a new housewife, refuses to follow these best practices, arguing that it just slows down development time.

Tanya calmly explains that while it may take a bit more time to follow best practices, it's worth it in the end to ensure the security of your website/application. The other housewives agree, and Claudia reluctantly agrees to try out the best practices.

## The Resolution

After implementing Tanya's best practices, all of the housewives report feeling more confident in the security of their code. Jamie is relieved that she won't have to deal with another hack again and thanks Tanya for her help.

Tanya reminds the housewives to keep up with using best practices, stay up to date with security vulnerabilities, and to always test their code.

And that's a wrap for this episode of Real Housewives of JavaScript! Remember to secure your code and stay tuned for more JavaScript drama!
Sure! Here’s an explanation of the code that was used to resolve the Real Housewives episodes.

## Code Explanation

### Validating User Input

We use the `Joi` module to validate user input, which allows us to create a schema for our expected input and check that user input matches that schema before using it in our code. Here's an example:

```javascript
const Joi = require('joi');
 
const schema = Joi.object().keys({
   username: Joi.string().alphanum().min(3).max(30).required(),
   password: Joi.string().regex(/^[a-zA-Z0-9]{3,30}$/),
   email: Joi.string().email({ minDomainAtoms: 2 })
});
 
Joi.validate({ username: 'abc123', birthyear: 1994 }, schema, function (err, value) { });
```

### Avoiding eval() and with() Methods

Eval() is a function in JavaScript that allows you to execute code passed as a string argument. Here's an example:

```javascript
eval('console.log("Hello, World!")');
```

With() is a method in JavaScript that allows you to access object properties without referencing the object itself. Here's an example:

```javascript
with (document.forms[0])
console.log(name.value);
```

Both eval() and with() methods can pose security risks and, hence, should be avoided. 

### Avoiding Inline Scripts

Inline scripts or event handlers can be dangerous if not properly validated, as they can execute arbitrary code or even allow attackers to inject their own code. 

The following are examples of acceptable inline scripts:

```html
<button id="btn">Click me!</button>
    
<script>
  document.getElementById('btn').addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert('Hello, World!');
  });
</script>
```

### Using Content Security Policy (CSP)

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security feature that helps prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by allowing only trusted sources of content to be loaded by a web page. 

```html
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://apis.google.com;
```

### Handling Errors Gracefully

It's important to handle errors gracefully, without revealing detailed error messages and stack traces to users. 

```javascript
app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
  console.error(err);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
```

By following these best practices, you can secure your JavaScript code and ensure that your website or application is safe from cyber attacks.
